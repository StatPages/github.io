occurrence of one or more events that might indicate possible problems in study 
design (ambiguous inclusion criteria, misinterpretation of questionnaire items)

other safety markers). Enter the prevalence rate you want to be able to detect 
(like one in a hundred), and the probabibility you want to have of seeing at 
least one such event in your sample (like 95% probability), and the page will 
tell you how many subjects you need in the study. (added 08/05/2015)</p>
