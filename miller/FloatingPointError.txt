There are several reasons for getting the error message "not a valid floating point value".  Here are my recommendations:

1.   Watch the tutorials, especially the first one.
2.   Look at your data - is there a blank column?  If so, click on it and then go to the Edit menu and select delete column.
3.   Go to the Variables and click on the Define option.  Be sure each variable name has NO blanks in it.  Use short labels (less than 9 characters).
      Be sure that each variable is correctly defined for the type of analysis to be performed (0 for floating point, 1 for integer, 2 for a string.
      If the variable is an integer, it should have a zero (0) for the number of decimal places.  Define a missing value for blank values of a variable (the default is a 99999).
      In your data grid, be sure you enter the missing value for any blank values in your data.
      Go to the Edit menu and click the option to Format the grid.
      If there are any extra rows with blanks, click on the empty row and go to the Edit menu and click delete row.
4.   Save your data as a .TEX file.
5.   Try to do the analysis again.  if it fails, send me an email with the file attached for me to examine.  Tell me in the email what your intended analysis was.
