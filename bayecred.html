<p>
This page allows the credibility of a clinical trial finding to be assessed
in the light of current knowledge.
</p><p>
Many clinical trials produce "statistically significant" evidence for the
efficacy of some new therapy. However, statistical significance is a notoriously
poor indicator of the <i>credibility</i> of a finding - that is, the extent
to which it provides convincing evidence for efficacy - as it fails to take
full account of the size of the trial, or of pre-existing insights.
</p><p>
This page takes the outcome of a given clinical trial - as summarised by
the published Odds Ratio (OR) together with its 95 % confidence interval
(CI) - and uses a Bayesian method due to Matthews (2001) to determine the
credibility of the finding in the light of what is already known. Specifically,
it shows whether the new finding, when combined with existing knowledge,
can be taken to have credibly demonstrated efficacy at the 95% confidence
level. Such a finding is said to be <i>credible at the 95% confidence
level</i>.
</p><p>
For a given result to meet this standard, the prior evidence for efficacy
must exceed a specific level; this level is captured by the <i>Critical Odds
Ratio (COR)</i>, the quantity calculated by this page. The assessment of
a given clinical trial result can then proceed as follows:
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <b>If the stated 95% confidence interval excludes an OR of 1.00 (corresponding
    to no effect), the result can be deemed <i>statistically significant at the
    95% level</i>;</b>
  </li><li>
    <b>If ORs <i>at least as impressive </i>as that indicated by the COR can
    be justified by existing knowledge, the result can also be deemed <i>credible
    at the 95% level </i></b>
</li></ol>
<p>
The COR produced by this page reflects both the effect-size and the statistical
power of the clinical trial under study. Thus trials involving large numbers
of patients and/or large effect sizes will typically produce undemanding
CORs, which are easily justified on the basis of current knowledge. On the
other hand, trials involving relatively few patients, and/or small effect
sizes will - because they possess relatively little evidential weight - produce
CORs that demand a substantial amount of prior evidence before the new result
can be deemed credible.
</p><p>
<b><i>Example</i></b>: The Grampian Region Early Anistreplase (GREAT) study
(1992) found that patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction had
lower 3-month mortality if given anistreplase early. The finding was summarised
as an OR of 0.47, with a 95% CI of (0.23, 0.97). As the latter excludes an
OR of 1.00, the result is statistically significant at the 95% level. However,
entering this 95% CI into the window below leads to a COR of 0.087. Thus
the result can be deemed credible at the 95% level <i>only if </i>ORs for
mortality even more impressive (i.e. lower) than around 0.09 can be justified
in the light of current knowledge about the effectiveness of anistreplase.
Pocock and Spiegelhalter (1992) found that extant knowledge indicated that
ORs below 0.4 were implausible. Thus ORs below the calculated COR level of
0.087 are not plausible, and the findings of the GREAT study may be deemed
statistically significant but not credible at the 95% level. Subsequent
experience has borne out this assessment.
</p><p>
<b>NB</b>: The CRO is based on the <i>equipoise assumption</i> of
ethical
randomised clinical trials (RCTs), according to which patients
allocated
to either arm of the trial are deemed equally likely to benefit. The
CRO
can thus be used to assess the credibility of meta-analyses of RCTs, as
well
as with individual trials. It can also be used to assess evidence from
observational studies using the concept of the "fair minded sceptic",
which implies a prior distribution identical to that based on the
equipoise assumption.

  </p><p>
  If ORs <b>less than</b> 1.0 are indicative of efficacy, then this trial is
  credible <b>only</b> if ORs <b>less than</b>
  <input name="Ll" size="8" value="" type="text"> are already plausible in the

  If ORs <b>greater than</b> 1.0 are indicative of efficacy, then this trial

  <font color="Purple"><b>Note 1:</b> Clinical trial findings that fail to
  produce evidence of efficacy at the 95% confidence level (i.e. whose results
  are "not statistically significant") cannot be credible at the 95% level.
  Entering the confidence limits for such findings will produce the result
  "NaN" ("Not a Number"). If one of the confidence limits is exactly 1.0, then
  one of the results will be "Inf" ("Infinity").</font>
  </p><p>
  <font color="Purple"><b>Note 2: </b>There's nothing special about the 95%
  confidence level. If you enter the 99% confidence interval, you will get
  the 99% critical odds ratio. </font>
